# Deploying the Microservices

- Prepare the Cloud9 environment and EKS cluster for this module

```bash
prepare-environment introduction/getting-started
```

- First, inspect the current namespaces in the EKS cluster

```bash
kubectl get namespace
```

- Check application specific namespaces, there should be none

```bash
kubectl get namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop
```

- This application uses Kustomize to manage Kubernetes deployments
- The Kustomization manifest lists all the microservices components
- Review all the components by looking inside the YAML file. 
- Expect to see:
  - `catalog`, `carts`, `checkout`, `assets`, `orders`, `ui`, `other`, `rabbitmq`

```bash
cat ~/environment/eks-workshop/base-application/kustomization.yaml
```

- Deploy all the components in one go

```bash
kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/base-application
```

- Check the deployment pods of the `catalog` component
- The status of pods will go through the following states:
  - `ContainerCreating` > `CrashLoopBackOff` > `Running`
- Reason being, the `catalog` Pod shows `CrashLoopBackOff` while `catalog-mysql` is getting ready to provide service. 
- Kubernetes keep restarting meanwhile

```bash
kubectl get pod -n catalog
```

- The `kubectl wait` helps to monitor Ready state before issuing other commands

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --timeout=180s pods \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop -A
```

- Recheck namespaces for application components
- There should be one for each

```bash
kubectl get namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop
```

- Check to confirm that the Deployments are created successfully

```bash
kubectl get deployment -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop -A
```

# Testing Microservices Deployments

- Once pods are up and running, we can check their logs
  - TIP: `-f` option helps to tail the log. Ctrl-C to quit.

```bash
kubectl logs -n catalog -f deployment/catalog
```

- At this points, all pods should be in running state
- For catalog, I only deployed 1 replica

```bash
kubectl get pod -n catalog
```

- Use Kubernetes `scale` command to horizontally scale out the number of pods
- Fire both commands together

```bash
kubectl scale -n catalog --replicas 3 deployment/catalog
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pods --all -n catalog --timeout=180s
```

- Rollout status check is another way to monitor replica scaling process

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/catalog -n catalog
```

- Confirm scaling

```bash
kubectl get pod -n catalog
```

- The manifests also create a **Service** the application and MySQL Pods 
- **Services** are used by other components inside the cluster to connect

```bash
kubectl get svc -n catalog
```

- Note: All the Services are internal to the cluster
  - Cannot be accessed from the Internet or even the VPC
- Check the configuration

```bash
cat ~/environment/eks-workshop/base-application/catalog/service.yaml
```

- To connect internally
- The `kubectl exec` is used to connect internally to access an existing Pod
  - The command below invokes the catalog API
  - It pulls a JSON payload with product information

```bash
kubectl -n catalog exec -it \
  deployment/catalog -- curl catalog.catalog.svc/catalogue | jq .
```

# Cleaning UP

- First use delete-environment to remove the sample application and also remove any leftover lab infrastructure

```bash
delete-environment
```

- Delete cluster using eksctl in the Cloud9 terminal

```bash
eksctl delete cluster $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME --wait
```

- Delete the cloudformaiton stack from the CloudShell terminal

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name eks-workshop-v1
```
